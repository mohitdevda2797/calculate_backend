# Calculator Backend

This is a Django project and uses Django REST framework for providing GET, POST, PUT, DELETE APIs to perform data manipulation on Operations model.

## Task
Task was to create user interaction based APIs that allows users to add Operations to the backend so that those operations can be used at the frontend to perform calculations.

## Solution
1. Created a simple model to hold python code for calculation with few other columns that will be used at the frontend for executing operations.
2. Created APIs for REST requests - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
3. Created an API for accepting parameters and perform operation and finally return the result.
